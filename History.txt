=== 0.2.3
* FIXES:
  * HUGE memory leak, no GSL object was ever freed.
  * Remove -march flag for MAC
* LOTS of improvements:
  * Added map_array: a map() version that actually returns an Array instead of a Vector/Matrix
  * Now you use the & idiom for map methods and such (like map_array(&:to_s))
  * Added Matrix#each_row / Matrix#each_column (which pass row and column matrices to the block)
  * Added Matrix#row_vecview / Matrix#column_vecview (construct a row and column Matrix::View)
  * Added Matrix#each_vec_row / Matrix#each_vec_column (same as the previous ones, but the block will receive a Vector::View instead)
  * Added x, y, z and w accessors for Vector (this will probably go into Vector2, Vector3 and Vector4 in the future)
  * "negate" operator
  * Documentation is now YARD based. This will significantly improve the documentation readability.
  * Added Vector#map_index! and Vector#wrap!
  * Initial support for Random Number Generators (only Uniform and Gaussian distributions for the moment)
  * Added Vector#<, #>, #<= and #>=
  * Added Matrix#map_with_index!
  * No more #fast_each and stuff. Now #each IS fast. This is accomplished by writing actual Ruby-C code instead of using FFI for
    these functions.
  * Initial support for GSL's special functions
